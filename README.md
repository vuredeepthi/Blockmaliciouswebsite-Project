title- Block Malicious website

The Website Blocker Tool is a Python-based application designed to help users block or unblock specific websites easily through a simple graphical interface. Malicious and distracting websites have become a significant concern in today’s digital world, where cybercriminals use harmful domains to spread malware, conduct phishing attacks, or steal personal information. At the same time, social media and entertainment sites can reduce productivity for students and professionals. This project addresses both challenges by providing a straightforward yet effective solution.

The tool is built using Tkinter for its graphical user interface, making it user-friendly and accessible even for beginners. It works by modifying the system’s hosts file, a critical configuration file that maps hostnames to IP addresses. By redirecting harmful or unwanted websites to the local address 127.0.0.1, the program ensures that users cannot access them through a web browser. The blocked sites simply fail to load, keeping users safe or focused.

The application includes three main buttons: Block, Unblock, and Exit. With a single click, the user can block malicious domains, restore access when needed, or close the tool. It also uses pop-up message boxes to notify users of successful actions or permission errors. Since editing the hosts file requires elevated privileges, the tool provides error messages prompting users to run the program as an administrator when necessary.

This project demonstrates the practical use of Python in solving real-world problems in cybersecurity and productivity management. It can be easily customized by adding more domains to the block list or adapted for broader use cases. Future improvements could include a more advanced interface, scheduled blocking (for study or work hours), and automatic updates from known malicious website databases.

Overall, the Website Blocker Tool offers a lightweight, practical, and educational approach to safer and more controlled internet usage.
